# PCOS-Detection

The proposed system that can help in the early detection of PCOS treatment with the help of ultrasound ovary images. To detect whether a woman is suffering from PCOS, 3 different machine learning classifiers like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression, and two different Convolution Neural Network algorithms like Sequential CNN and Inception V3 have been used.

# Output
